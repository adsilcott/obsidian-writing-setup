This is the beginning of a story about [[Bob]]. Suddenly something happened. [note:: I should figure this out later] Bob didn't like it. 
Assuming this page is displaying properly, it should be dark on light text using the excellent iA Writer Duo font. 
Paragraphs are created with a single return and are indented like you would find in a book. Lines are limited in length.
