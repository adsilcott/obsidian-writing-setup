This is the beginning of a story about [[Bob]]. Suddenly something happened. [note:: I should figure this part out later] Bob didn't like it. 
Assuming this page is displaying properly, it should be dark on light text using the excellent iA Writer Duo font. [note::When you no longer need an inline note, just delete it.]
Paragraphs are created with a single return and are indented like you would find in a book. Lines are limited in length. (Note that this only works in editing mode.)
To see and edit properties, hover over the Properties label or open the Properties tab. You can remove this behavior by removing the "hidden-properties" value from the "cssclasses" property in the scene template.
